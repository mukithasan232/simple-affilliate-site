# Admin & Landing Page Enhancement Update

## 🌟 What's New?

### 1. **Easier Access: Admin Link on Landing Page**
- **New Feature**: Added a **"Shield" Icon / Admin Button** directly in the Navigation Bar of the main website.
- **Benefit**: You no longer need to scroll to the footer or type the URL manually. Just click the lock icon in the top right.

### 2. **Admin Panel 2.0: Professional & "100% OK"**
- **Redesign**: Switched from "Cyberpunk" to a **"Professional Clean Dark"** theme. It’s much easier on the eyes and feels like a premium SaaS dashboard.
- **Usability**:
  - **Clearer Forms**: Better labels, placeholders, and helper text ("e.g., https://amzn.to/...").
  - **Robust Uploads**: The image uploader gives better feedback ("Uploading...").
  - **Error Handling**: Friendly messages if something goes wrong (e.g., "Title is required").
- **Reliability**: Ensured all API connections are solid.

## 🚀 How to Test
1. **Go to Homepage**: Refresh `index.html` or view it in browser.
2. **Find Admin**: Look at the top right Navbar for the **Admin** button (Shield Icon).
3. **Try Admin Panel**: 
   - Click it to open `admin.html`.
   - Try adding a new Category (e.g., "Smart Home").
   - Try adding a product with an image upload.

## ✅ Status
- **Server**: Running at `http://localhost:4000`.
- **Frontend**: Updated `index.html` and `admin.html`.
